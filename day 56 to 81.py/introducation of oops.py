""" there are two types of programming :(1) procedural programming 
(2) OBJECT - ORINTATED PROGRAMMING (OOPS): oops to allow to developers to model real world 
concept and entities using classes and objects,encapsulte the data ,reuse the code through 
inheritance and more flexiable code through polymorphism. 

encapsulte the data: which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and 
can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods.

inheritance:which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and 
methods of an existing class.

polymorphism:which means that objects of different classes can be treated as 
if they were objects of a common class."""
